# Nudged Elastic Band Tutorial

 A simple walkthrough and template for NEB runs on VASP.

When I worked in a computational materials research group, I had to run Nudged Elastic Band simulations. Finding tutorials and/or templates for this on VASP where pretty diffuicult.

I decided to put together a simple template for VASP, which incloves NEB runs using the VTST packages and phonon frequency runs
